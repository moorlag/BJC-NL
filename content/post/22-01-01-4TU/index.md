Windmolens in Snap!
<!--more-->

Despite recurring efforts into recruiting more women, their numbers in Dutch bachelor
programs remain low. One of the new forms of teaching CS that succeeds in attracting a more
diverse student audience, and in particular women, is Berkeleyâ€™s The Beauty and Joy of
Computing (BJC). Moreover, in the US BJC is also successful in secondary schools. In this project
we have successfully created a roadmap for translation, adaptation and evaluation of BJC in
Dutch and translated BJC in Dutch. The effort has been supported by a diverse group of
volunteers ranging from secondary school students to professionals, as well as by student
assistants who have finalized the translation. The result of this effort is a website [De
Schoonheid en Vreugde van Programmeren](https://bjoc-nl.github.io/) providing a series of
lessons that can be used as part of Computer Science lessons at secondary schools.
